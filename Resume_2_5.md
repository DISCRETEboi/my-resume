<h3><u style = 'color:#005090'>INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE (FREELANCE)</u></h3>
 
<b>REDEVELOPMENT OF THE PROGNOSIS TOOL OF A BETTING PLATFORM</b> [[Github]](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/wis-kickform)  
A [betting platform](https://www.thepunterspage.com/kickform/) owned by [Web International Services](https://www.wis-ltd.net/) required some re-engineering of its backend application. The issue was with the machine learning algorithm being improperly implemented - the betting odds being calculated were not as expected. I corrected the necessary errors in the source code written in R, and the application was giving out the expected results again.

<b>DIAGNOSIS AND REDESIGN OF SOME SLOW RUNNING SERVER APPLICATION</b>
[[Github]](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/app-optimize)  
A number of clinical monitoring applications, owned by [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/) and developed using R, were taking a long time to start. The task requirement was to optimize the startup time of the applications. I reverse-engineered the source codes and redesigned the data storage systems, keeping all the interface intact. The applications had about 5 times decrease in startup time after the redesigns.

<b>API TO THE <i>NAIRALANDGO</i> APPLICATION</b>
[[Github]](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/nairaland-go-api)  
An [API](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/nairaland-go-api) was built to enable public access to the [*nairalandgo*](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/nairaland-go) application. The API, developed in Go, was designed to accept an HTTP POST request containing the thread link as JSON data, and returns as response the base64 encoding of the PDF document contents. The *nairalandgo* application was hosted on a linux server, which was operated remotely using SSH.  
Skills utilized:- **Golang**, **REST API**, **SSH**, **SFTP**, **Linux**

<b>APPLICATION WHICH COLLECTS NAIRALAND USERS DATA FROM THEIR PROFILE PAGES</b>
[[Github]](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/nairaland-data-scrape)  
The application, built with Golang, crawls the [Nairaland website](https://www.nairaland.com/), collecting the users' data from their profile pages. The data collected include username, profile link, location, last seen etc. All the data collected are then organized and stored in csv files.  
Skills utilized:- **Golang**, **Web scraping**, **Regular expressions**
