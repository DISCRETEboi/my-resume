<h3><u span style = 'color: #005090'>SUMMARY</u></h3>

Proficient R & Backend Developer with extensive experience building data products in the R programming environment. Proven ability of developing R Shiny applications, R packages, rich R Markdown reports and R automation scripts. Skilled in API server development and administration. Highly organized, motivated and diligent. Experienced in using project management tools like Git, Trello. Enthusiastic about contributing to team success through hard work, attention to detail and excellent communication skills.

<h3><u style = 'color:#005090'>INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE (FREELANCE)</u></h3>

**CLIENT:** [**Web International Services, Malta**](https://www.wis-ltd.net/)  
A [sport betting platform](https://www.thepunterspage.com/kickform/) owned by Web International Services required re-engineering of one of its back-end systems, written in R, which generates prognosis of football matches. The issue was the machine learning algorithm being wrongly implemented. I rewrote the source code to match the algorithm design, and the system was giving out the expected results again.

**CLIENT:** [**AstraZeneca, UK**](https://www.astrazeneca.com/)  
I worked on a couple of tasks which include:  
- Development of R packages from sparse scripts and documentation files  
- Redevelopment of slow-running R Shiny applications by optimizing their backend design (achieved an average 4x increase in performance)  
- Development of R Markdown scripts to generate HTML web page prototypes, rich in dynamic features such as Shiny UI elements  
- Writing R scripts to automate information extraction from large R codebases e.g. SQL queries extraction from commands in R scripts  
- Development of rigorous unit tests for existing R packages

<b>WHATSAPP CHATS ANALYZER WEB APPLICATION</b>
[[Live app]](https://mateen-a-q.shinyapps.io/whatsapp-chats-breakdown/)  
The application, built with R and R Shiny, extracts key information from an uploaded text file of WhatsaApp chats, and presents a dashboard summary of the messaging activities between the chat participants.  
Skills utilized: **R**, **R Shiny**, **Regular expressions**, **Data Visualization**, **ggplot2**

<b>APPLICATION WHICH COLLECTS AN ONLINE FORUM'S USESRS DATA (WITH WEBSITE INTERFACE & API)</b>
[[Github]](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/nairaland-data-scrape)  
The application, built with Golang, crawls the [Nairaland website](https://www.nairaland.com/), collecting the users' data from their profile pages. The data collected include username, profile link, location, last seen etc. All the data collected are then organized and stored in csv files.  
* The [web interface](https://mateen-a-q.shinyapps.io/nairalanddata/) to the application, built with R Shiny, presents all the data collected in a compact tabular form on a webpage. The total number of records available in the data is up to 30,000. Various interactive features are added to the webpage for easy exploration of the data.  
* An API was built to enable public access to the application. The API, also developed in Golang, was designed to accept HTTP POST requests containing the desired thread link as JSON data, and returns as response the data collected. The original application was hosted on a Linux server, which was operated remotely using the SSH protocol.  
Skills utilized:- **Golang**, **Web scraping**, **R**, **R Shiny**, **Regular expressions**, **reactable**, **UI design**, **REST API**, **SSH**, **SFTP**, **Linux**, **Bash**
