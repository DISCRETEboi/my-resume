<h3><u span style = 'color: #005090'>SUMMARY</u></h3>

Proficient R Developer with extensive experience building data products in the R programming environment. Proven ability of developing R Shiny applications, R packages, R Markdown reports and R automation scripts. Sound understanding of statistical and analytical techniques useful for rational decision making. Highly organized, motivated and diligent. Experienced in using project management tools like Git, Trello. Enthusiastic about contributing to team success through hard work, attention to detail and excellent communication skills.

<h3><u style = 'color:#005090'>INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE (FREELANCE)</u></h3>

**CLIENT:** [**Web International Services, Malta**](https://www.wis-ltd.net/)  
A [sport betting platform](https://www.thepunterspage.com/kickform/) owned by Web International Services required some re-engineering of one of its back-end application, which generates all prognosis. The issue was with the machine learning algorithm being wrongly implemented. I corrected the necessary errors in the source code written in R, and the application was giving out the expected results again.

**CLIENT:** [**AstraZeneca, UK**](https://www.astrazeneca.com/)  
I worked on a couple of tasks which include:  
- Development of R packages from sparse scripts and documentation files  
- Re-development of slow-running R shiny applications by optimizing the back-end design of the application (achieved an average 4x increase in performance).  
- Development of R Markdown sources to generate web page prototypes, rich in dynamic features such as Shiny UI elements
- Writing R scripts to automate information extraction from large R codebases e.g. SQL queries extraction from commands in R scripts  
- Development of rigorous unit tests for existing R packages

<b>APPLICATION WHICH PRODUCES A PDF SUMMARY OF ALL POSTS ON A THREAD OF AN ONLINE FORUM, NAIRALAND</b>
[[Github]](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/nairaland-go)  
The application [*nairalandgo*](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/nairaland-go) built with Golang takes in a Nairaland thread url, which could contain hundreds of webpages, and produces a PDF document containing the whole posts in thread, along with the number of likes, usernames etc. The user interacts with the application through the command line.  
Skills utilized:- **Golang**, **Web scraping**, **UI design**, **HTML templating**

<b>API TO THE <i>NAIRALANDGO</i> APPLICATION</b>
[[Github]](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/nairaland-go-api)  
An [API](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/nairaland-go-api) was built to enable public access to the [*nairalandgo*](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/nairaland-go) application. The API, developed in Go, was designed to accept an HTTP POST request containing the thread link as JSON data, and returns as response the base64 encoding of the PDF document contents. The *nairalandgo* application was hosted on a linux server, which was operated remotely using SSH.  
Skills utilized:- **Golang**, **REST API**, **SSH**, **SFTP**, **Linux**

<b>APPLICATION WHICH COLLECTS NAIRALAND USERS DATA FROM THEIR PROFILE PAGES</b>
[[Github]](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/nairaland-data-scrape)  
The application, built with Golang, crawls the [Nairaland website](https://www.nairaland.com/), collecting the users' data from their profile pages. The data collected include username, profile link, location, last seen etc. All the data collected are then organized and stored in csv files.  
Skills utilized:- **Golang**, **Web scraping**, **Regular expressions**
