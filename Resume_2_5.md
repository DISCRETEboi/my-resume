<h3><u span style = 'color: #005090'>SUMMARY</u></h3>

Proficient R & Backend Developer with extensive experience building data products in the R programming environment. Proven ability of developing R Shiny applications, R packages, R Markdown reports and R automation scripts. Skilled in Golang server app development too. Highly organized, motivated and diligent. Experienced in using project management tools like Git, Trello. Enthusiastic about contributing to team success through hard work, attention to detail and excellent communication skills.

<h3><u style = 'color:#005090'>INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE (FREELANCE)</u></h3>

**CLIENT:** [**Web International Services, Malta**](https://www.wis-ltd.net/)  
A [sport betting platform](https://www.thepunterspage.com/kickform/) owned by Web International Services required some re-engineering of one of its back-end application, which generates all prognosis. The issue was with the machine learning algorithm being wrongly implemented. I corrected the necessary errors in the source code written in R, and the application was giving out the expected results again.

**CLIENT:** [**AstraZeneca, UK**](https://www.astrazeneca.com/)  
I worked on a couple of tasks which include:  
- Development of R packages from sparse scripts and documentation files  
- Re-development of slow-running R shiny applications by optimizing the back-end design of the application (achieved an average 4x increase in performance)  
- Development of R Markdown sources to generate web page prototypes, rich in dynamic features such as Shiny UI elements  
- Writing R scripts to automate information extraction from large R codebases e.g. SQL queries extraction from commands in R scripts  
- Development of rigorous unit tests for existing R packages

Skills utilized: **R**, **R Shiny**, **Regular expressions**, **Data Visualization**, **ggplot2**

<b>APPLICATION WHICH PRODUCES A PDF SUMMARY OF ALL POSTS ON A THREAD OF THE ONLINE FORUM, NAIRALAND</b>
[[Github]](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/nairaland-go)  
The application [*nairalandgo*](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/nairaland-go), built with Golang, takes in a [Nairaland](https://www.nairaland.com/) thread URL which could contain hundreds of webpages, and produces a PDF document containing all posts in thread, along with the usernames, number of likes etc. The user interacts with the application through the command line.  
Skills utilized:- **Web scraping**, **Golang**, **UI design**, **HTML templating**

<b>API TO THE <i>NAIRALANDGO</i> APPLICATION</b>
[[Github]](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/nairaland-go-api)  
An [API](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/nairaland-go-api) was built to enable public access to the [*nairalandgo*](https://github.com/DISCRETEboi/nairaland-go) application. The API, developed in Golang, was designed to accept an HTTP POST request containing the desired thread link as JSON data, and returns as response the base64 encoding of the PDF document contents. The *nairalandgo* application was hosted on a linux server, which was operated remotely using SSH.  
Skills utilized:- **REST API**, **SSH**, **SFTP**, **Linux**, **Bash**, **Golang**
